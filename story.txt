  There once was a thousand-year-old weasel named Bob who lived in a busy city. He worked as web developer, and everyday he road his sloth, Frank, to work.  From the day that Bob started his first job and for hundreds of years, Frank safely got Bob to work despite the high sloth to sloth collision rate in the city. 
  One ordinary day on Bob's ride to work, a billboard caught his eye. "Three Wishes Inc. We can make your wishes come true!," it read. Bob looked at his sloth and then back at the billboard. He knew immediately what he needed to do.
