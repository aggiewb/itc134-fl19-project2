  There once was a thousand-year-old weasel named Bob who lived in a busy city. He worked as web developer, and everyday he road his sloth, Frank, to work.  From the day that Bob started his first job and for hundreds of years, Frank safely got Bob to work despite the high sloth to sloth collision rate in the city. 
  One ordinary day on Bob's ride to work, a billboard caught his eye. "Three Wishes Inc. We make your wishes come true!," it read. Bob looked at his sloth and then back at the billboard. He knew immediately what he needed to do. 
  Bob squinted his weasel eyes against the glinting morning sunlight. He typed the billboard's phone number into his phone. Frank the sloth scratched at the gravel in frustration. He wanted to continue on so that they wouldn't hit sloth rush hour. Bob couldn't be late for work again.
  "Thank you for calling Three Wishes Inc. We make your wishes come true!"
  "Hello, my name is Bob."
  "Hi Bob! How can we help you?"
  "Can I wish for a million wishes? And how much is this gonna cost me?"
